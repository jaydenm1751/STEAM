The oldest known form of the game is shown in a painting from the tomb of Hesy (circa 2686-2613 BCE). Many pictures of the game and artifacts have been discovered and are displayed in Museums around the world. The commonness of these finds indicates that the game was very popular in its time.\n\nThe main adversaries in Senet are the Spools and the Pyramids. These pawns follow a path from their start positions to the House of Horus in an inverted 'S'. The player moving all of his pawns off the board first wins. Fields on the Senet board are called houses. Some of these have special significance and are adorned with icons like the Ankh symbol. Instead of dice flattened sticks are used. Each stick has a bright side and a dark side. Every bright side is a point. If only dark sides are showing the player is awarded 5 points. When a 1, 4, or 5 is thrown the player gets another turn.\n\nWhen moving into a field occupied by an opponent, the pieces switch places. If, however, the opponent's pawn is part of a row of two or more, it cannot be beaten. It is possible to 'jump' over an opponent if it isn't part of a row of 3 pieces or more. 3 pieces are considered a block and are an important strategic tool.\n\nThrough symbology Senet hints at the afterlife as seen from an Egyptian point of view. If one's piece is beaten on one of the last three fields or the jump over the House of Water is not successful one moves back to the house of Rebirth. In such the game alludes to reincarnation and the journey of the dead.\n\nSenet Deluxe is a truly unique strategy game. It features great animation, a soundtrack, an intelligent adversary, enforceable backwards moves, highlighting for acceptable moves, game statistics and online help. Be prepared to spend many hours with the most popular game of the antiquity.\n\nFor more screenshots and several videos of the application in action, please visit the website indicated below.""",RoGame Software,4+,"DA, NL, EN, FR, DE, EL, IT, JA, KO, NO, PT, RU, ZH, ES, SV",34689024,Games,"Games, Strategy, Board, Education",18/07/2008,22/07/2018

Buy low, sell high. What's cheap in one city may be expensive in another. \n\nYou\u2019ll need to fund your operations by borrowing money. But be careful, the cost of borrowing in this world can be very high so you'll need to know the cost of goods to keep ahead of those interest charges\u2026\n\nTo make progress you'll need to aim high. Borrow as much as you can get but only when you know what you\u2019re going to buy and that you're getting a good price.

It's not about the war game or any other shooter games, its literally about painting the ball. There is a given pattern of colored balls and some pipes around them. You are given an amount of paint color to draw and change the color of any of the balls in the scene trying to match 3, 4 or 5 balls near a pipe, this way the pipes suck these matched balls and new paint is given to you. The gameplay is very different from the well known and cloned match 3 swapping candy fluffy games like candy crush soda and candy crush saga games. Try it and you'll get hooked.\n\n\u2022 Game Objective:\nYou have to make groups of 3 or more balls of the same color. These groups must be made next to a pipe. Paint balls by tapping on them. When you click on the ball you wish to paint, the ball changes color and the group gets sucked into the pipe.\n\n\u2022 Tips:\nUsing the same pipe makes it hot. If a pipe becomes extra hot the balls are transformed into multi-color which gives you extra points & life. Letters appear on some balls. When balls are grouped, the letter taken, complete the word 'PaintBall' on the bottom. When all word is completed a big bonus is earned!\n\n\u2022 Hard: The Hard game works exactly like the Easy game, but you have to play fast because your paint reserve is dripping! If it runs out, you lose.\n\u2022 Panic: In Panic mode you have 100 sec. to score as much as possible. This is not all! Your paint reserve is dripping & there are no black balls. This makes it easier to make groups.\n\u2022 Heat: In this mode, ball groups are taken only when they are next to a hot (red) pipe. Each time this happens active (red) pipes are moved. There are no black balls, which makes it easier to make groups. This mode needs planning!\n\u2022 Chroma: In the Chroma mode you will have to play using color combinations e.g.: if you have yellow paint & the ball you want to paint is blue. Blue and yellow will be: Green. Use the color wheel to keep track. If you mix opposite colors you get black.\n\nFEATURES\n* award winning gameplay\n* hours of gameplay craziness - mania guaranteed\n* many modes to play\n* fast playing ideal for waiting rooms/buses\n* Export Hi-Scores to internet\n* change ball styles\n\nPRESS:\n-----\nUIQ 2008 Open Winner for the games category! \n-----\ngamefreaks365: So, do you need Paintball 2?

When one stone lands on another of the same color, this stone as well as all bordering stones of the same color disappear. The goal is, of course, to empty the field \u2013 so far, so good.  \n\nYet, this simple concept leads to surprisingly challenging functions, and the variety of strategic possibilities make Pebbles an absorbing game. \n\nA shelf above the playing field shows which stone is going to come next. Knowing which stone is going to follow is a deciding factor in the game\u2019s strategy. \n\nChoosing the sequence of the moves with care is also very important: a well positioned pebble can do more than just eliminate others; it can also be the basis for up coming moves, just as a badly positioned pebble can prove to be terribly obstructive.  \n\nThe level of difficulty increases with the number of pebbles that are in the playing field at the start of a game as well as the number of different colors.",Objective Development,4+,"EN, DE",10136576,Games,"Games, Strategy, Board, Entertainment",28/04/2009,20/01/2016

You can purchase upgrade modules via in App Purchase.\n\n(C) 1986-2011,\nRolf-Dieter Klein, Martin Ulrich,\nMunich, Bremen, Germany\n\nPorts of Call has a long tradition \nthe first version was released\non the Amiga 1986 with other versions\nfollowing.\n\nNow the classic game is getting mobil.\nWe kept the classic interface and design by intention, as this was a user request since years - an update for full screen support will follow soon, also other versions are on our wish and todo list.\n\nA Background on Tramp Shipping:\n\nThe traffic of goods by sea is organized \nin accordance with international agreements and contracts between individual countries. \nAbout 80% of the goods (called ""cargo volume"") transported between two countries is handled by ships registered under the flags of the countries concerned. The remaining 20% are \nopen to the free competition of ships under other flags. These ships, called ""tramp"" ships, are usually prepared to transport all kinds of goods. This aspect of the shipping business is the focus of Ports of Call.\n\nThe Object of the Game\n\nEach player founds his own shipping \ncompany, with a starting capital of $4.6 million to buy ships. Freight and ports of call can be chosen continuously from offers on the market.\nThen the captain chooses an economic travelling speed and casts off to encounter many adventures on the high seas.\n\nAfter unloading his cargo, the captain \nis credited with the agreed payment.\nThen he may refuel, make necessary repairs, and so on. The next job is to find a new, lucrative cargo, buy further ships, and/or repay his mortgages; in other words, he must have a more productive company than his competitors.\n\nA player\'s chances of success improve \nthe more he knows about international \nshipping. All data for the game originated from actual developments in the maritime world: the fluctuation of freight rates, refueling costs, port charges, and ship operating costs.\n\nBut the game is not a pure economic game, \nalso a ship simulator is integrated, and\nthe captain can steer his ship manually,\neither if necessary, or to save money and\nget a good status.\n\nIn summary, Ports of Call has been developed with this motto in mind: \n""Software with Hard Facts.""\n\n\nlatest hints: start using preowned ships, and keep them in good condition to avoid disasters (like rats for example).\nTo avoid the burglar, visit your office in a regular interval.  \n\n\nhomepage: www.portsofcall.de\nsupport: www.rdkleinforum.de",Dipl.-Ing.

That\u2019s what they call the playing pieces in this game \u2013 bits. Yet you have already eliminated quite a few from the board , but you still have a ways to go to get down to just one bit and release the game\u2019s next memory.\n\nThis is more than a mere brain teaser, WORP requires you to really stretch your intellect. The funny thing is, you love every second of it.\n\nJust imagine training your brain and relaxing at the same time. The WORP app challenges you to intuitively learn the code for subtractive color synthesis while enjoying the electronic sounds of Konsorten\u2122. Don\u2019t let the fancy talk scare you off. You can definitely do this and have a ton of fun while you\u2019re at it.\n\nThe idea is to eliminate bits. You start the first game with primary bits. Select one and all possible moves are revealed to you. Okay, start jumping the neighboring bits until there is only one left. There are instances when combined bits will occur and that just adds a new, interesting dimension to the game. But pay attention that the bits don't get stuck.\n\nWhen you get down to one bit, WORP starts calculating and opens another memory for you to continue on with. Check out the screen shots to see what further challenges WORP has to offer.\n\nMade a mistake? Don\u2019t worry, just click the Undo button and try again. You might have to do that more than once. This application has three difficulty levels and nine different memories, which increase in difficulty as they go.\n\nIf you need to take a little break because your brain is overheating, WORP lets you save your game and come back to where you left off.\n\nWORP provides the atmospheric sounds that complete the experience for you. You are going to be totally immersed in this game.\n\nFeatures\n- 9 different memories of increasing difficulty\n- 3 difficulty levels \u2013 beginner, intermediate and advanced \u2013 for each of the 9 memories\n- Atmospheric sound design by Konsorten\u2122\n- Interrupt any time via the Home button \u2013 resume where you left off\n- Undo all moves even after resuming a game\n- Game center integration (Leaderboards + Achievements)\n\nShow yourself what you and your brain can do.

However,if more enemies hit on the skull tower, the health bar of the tower will decrease to a point it will be destroyed to ground.

You can also exchange all your soul points to repair your skull tower. \n\n\nSpells to research or upgrade:\n\n- Mana capacity - this is the ability to cast your spells. If you run out of mana, you cannot cast any more spells and your tower will be in danger. \n\n- Chain lightning damage - you can increase your damage of this spell to greater heights.\n\n- Hellfire - a fire from the hell that will burn your enemies to ashes. It works by drawing a circle over the affected area on the screen. The hellfire will ignite and set enemies within the chosen area on fire.\n\n- Frozen Touch - this spell will freeze your enemies and you can increase the duration for which they are frozen to delay time.\n\nIt works by double tapping the enemies to freeze them. After being frozen, the enemies cannot move or attack the skull tower.\n\nAddition character to summon:\n\n- Skeleton Archer - He will attack enemies automatically without you touching the screen.

Very few, unless you\u2019re talking about DodgeDot\u2122! What on earth can make a game so simple, yet so compelling and addictive? Why is the DodgeDot\u2122 player community so fanatic and dedicated?\n\nDodgeDot\u2122 is truly a game for everybody with players around the world from 2 years old to in their nineties. With over 22 miliion games played to date, it\u2019s incredibly simple to play. DodgeDot\u2122\u2019s basic rules can be described in less than a minute and many players learn the basics just by jumping in and quickly discovering them by trial and error. It\'s a game that can be played at a gentle and relaxing pace and yet also provides plenty of challenges for players that want to develop their dexterity, playing strategy, and overall game skills for competition. \nDodgeDot\u2122 is elegantly simple, yet produces infinitely rich gameplay:\n\n- Drag the moving colored dots to matching goals to score points\n- Clear all moving dots from field to advance to the next level\n- Avoid colliding with dots of different colors\n- Avoid contacting unmatched goals of different colors\n- Join dots of the same color to earn bonus points\n\nThe nature of the game\'s dynamics are infinitely variable, with its dots moving in different directions and speeds, and with time and every player interaction affecting the subsequent dot movement patterns and point values.\n\nDodgeDot\u2122 is also a visually pleasing game of colors.  Choose your favorite four-color schemes to play with, from a large selection of palettes.\n\n- New Game Rounds with fresh starting patterns for Levels automatically start every Monday!\n\n- Built in leaderboard network where you can have your own profile, see rank listings for players, friend other players,etc.\n\n- All registered Jampaq Network players have an opportunity to compete for fresh rankings every week!\n\n- Supports Apple\'s Game Center for high score leaderboard!\n \n- This is a universal application, so buy it for iPhone/iPod Touch and you can also install it on your iPad!\n\n*** WAS FEATURED ON Apple\'s ""WHAT\'S HOT"" LIST! ***\n\nDON\'T FORGET TO JOIN THE JAMPAQ NETWORK!\nREGISTRATION\'S FREE & SIMPLE IN-APP!\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \nWatch videos at: \nhttp://www.youtube.com/dodgedot \n\nHere\u2019s what DodgeDot\u2122 players have to say:\n\n\u201cTotal Addiction!!!!  It\u2019s hard to put it down.... The game is mesmerizing\u2026. I have come to the conclusion that the best games in the App Store are those that concentrate more on the gameplay and concept, and less on having the fanciest, largest game around. My favorite games are the simplest and most elegant \u2026 and DodgeDot\u2122 tops the list\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been playing DodgeDot\u2122 for over 3 years and still enjoy it as much as I did then. If people would only try it, they would be pleasantly surprised why it\u2019s such a great game that\u2019s hard to put down\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is truly one of the few games I absolutely cannot bring myself to delete, no matter how low I become on memory. This is a definite must buy!!!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is great for all ages (at age 63, I should know) and the video instructions are beautifully done. \u2026worth way more than you\u2019re payin\u2019. As a retired teacher, I view this as a fantastic opportunity to both develop... and retain thinking skills. These folks put a lot of thought into development and execution! Don\u2019t pass it up!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis game has all the makings of a timeless classic. I find myself always coming back to DodgeDot\u2122.\u201d\n\n""Soooooooo Addicting. Seems easy till it blows your mind and you throw your iPod/iPhone at the ground. Either way great game I simply can\'t stop playing.  ""\n\n""Excellent game. Entire family from 3 to 83 loves it""\n\n""This may be the winner on my list of \'Most addictive games for the iPad.\' My daughter is addicted, I\'m addicted and my mother is addicted! Love it, love it love it""\n\n""Deceivingly simple at first, and gets challenging pretty soon.

You have been ordered back to defend what is left and drive the swarmers back. \n\nYour ship, the first of its kind, is faster and more powerful that those in the destroyed fleet and so you stand a chance of victory if you can master the swarmer\'s tactics.  You ship is equipped with three weapons; a laser bank, torpedos and the ""Extirpator"" and a protective energy shield. Fully automated, you ship is ready for battle. It\'s up to you to save the galaxy.\n\nTo successfully complete you mission you must destroy all swarmers and protect at least two (2) space stations and two (2) planets from destruction without yourself being destroyed. Your ship is destroyed if the energy level or life support levels reach zero. \n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nGalaxy Trek is a turn-based strategy game, similar in concept to the old mainframe trek game. The galaxy is broken into 64 quadrants arranged in an 8x8 grid. Each quadrant is broken down into 64 sectors arranged in an 8x8 grid. You maneuver your ship across the galaxy, destroying swarmers before they can destroy inhabited planets and space stations. \n\nThe game is played turn-by-turn. That is, you play your turn in which you can complete a set of actions, then the swarmers have their turn in which their ships will perform a countering set of actions. This continues until one side is victorious.\n\nYou will be ranked on your performance throughout the mission.\n\nFeatures:\n--------------------\n- Three levels of difficulty.\n\n- Your game is saved when you exit so you can pick up where you left off.\n\n- Highest score is kept.\n\n- Can turn on/off features in the Settings console.\n\n- iPod music can play in the background.\n\n- Complete instructions with illustrations are available in the game - no need for a wireless connection to access them.

For 20 years, the Earth has been under the rule of the Global Confederation that united and brought under its control all the countries and continents.   The mankind entered a new era. Global territory wars that had been waged for a century subsided. The world economy no longer supported the military machine to be ready for action and turned towards the progress. The new scientific horizons on the Earth and in outer space were open. \n\nBut peace and quite in the Confederation is being increasingly disturbed by the outbreaks of rebellions of those who oppose the Senat's policies. The resistance movement is gaining momentum all over the world. The Senate throws the whole reserve of Condederation's scarce peace-keeping forces to suppress the rebellion.\n\nIn the east of Peru, near the city of Pucallpa, some signs of rebellious activity have been observed. Prior to that moment, South America was the calmest of regions. Your mission is to crush the revolt in Peru and to capture the leader of the rebellion.\n\nYou are charged with a mission on which the future of mankind depends. As a general of Confederation you are to suppress a revolt in Peru.\n\nTo attain the goal you must complete 7 missions of the campaign on diverse terrains from the Amazonian jungle to the mountain ranges of the Andes.

The game consists of a repeating sequence of bidding (for the right to name the trump suit and optionally to pass cards), melding, and trick-taking. Players score points by melding various card combinations and by taking tricks.\n\nIn this version, one human player (South) plays with a computer partner (North) and two computer opponents (West and East).\n\nBIDDING: Each player bids the number of points she thinks she can make with her hand. Player to the dealer's left is required to bid, and bidding proceeds to the left. Players who pass are out of the bidding for that hand. A typical high bid is 35 points (for 48 cards) or 60 (for 80 cards). High bidder names the trump suit for the hand and optionally exchanges cards with her partner.\n\nMELDING: Players get points by showing various card combinations. A run (or straight) in the trump suit is worth 15 points. Aces in all four suits is 10 points. Pinochle (queen of spades and jack of diamonds) is 4 points, or 30 points for double pinochle (two of each).\n\nTRICKS: Play begins with the high bidder, and proceeds around the table to the left, 4 cards per trick. Each trick has a winner, who gets 1 point per ace, ten or king.\n\nSCORING: If the high bidder fails to make the bid (his team's total meld plus trick points is less than the bid), the bid amount is subtracted from the team score.

Please see below for directions.\n\nOptia is a beautiful, immersive physics game about reflected light. You must activate all targets in each level with a laser beam, powering the transition to the next.\n\nFortunately, your puzzle-solving instincts come in handy here! Using a clever assortment of mirrors, you can reflect a beam in any direction, split it into two separate beams (or four, or eight, or sixteen...), and if you must, sacrifice your own laser to clear a path to that last target.\n\nAnd Optia doesn't end there! After cutting your teeth on the main campaign, you can create your own levels and upload them for others to play.\n\nWith 100 main levels, more than one thousand user-created levels, and a polished ecosystem for creating, playing, and rating new levels, you never really need to stop playing Optia.

Play single- or double-deck with configurable options including meld bids and shoot the moon. Pinochle is updated frequently with user-suggested features and AI improvements. Also available in the App Store is a paid version with NO advertising: Pinochle Gold.\n\nPinochle is a card game played with a 48- or 80-card deck of 9s, 10s, jacks, queens, kings and aces. The game consists of a repeating sequence of bidding (for the right to name the trump suit and optionally to pass cards), melding, and trick-taking. Players score points by melding various card combinations and by taking tricks.\n\nIn this version, one human player (South) plays with a computer partner (North) and two computer opponents (West and East).\n\nBIDDING: Each player bids the number of points she thinks she can make with her hand. Player to the dealer's left is required to bid, and bidding proceeds to the left. Players who pass are out of the bidding for that hand. A typical high bid is 35 points (for 48 cards) or 60 (for 80 cards). High bidder names the trump suit for the hand and optionally exchanges cards with her partner.\n\nMELDING: Players get points by showing various card combinations. A run (or straight) in the trump suit is worth 15 points. Aces in all four suits is 10 points. Pinochle (queen of spades and jack of diamonds) is 4 points, or 30 points for double pinochle (two of each).\n\nTRICKS: Play begins with the high bidder, and proceeds around the table to the left, 4 cards per trick. Each trick has a winner, who gets 1 point per ace, ten or king.\n\nSCORING: If the high bidder fails to make the bid (his team's total meld plus trick points is less than the bid), the bid amount is subtracted from the team score.

The matriarch is dying, and murder is in the air - whoever survives this night will walk away with a fortune!\n\nIn this nasty, conniving, and thoroughly awful multiplayer strategy game, players take on the role of one of the four nobles trying to kill off the others.  Each noble is surrounded by a retinue of leeches, hangers-ons, and sycophants who can be bent to your will through the use of blackmail, flattery, or intimidation.\n\nYour goal is to gain influence over these subordinates, give one of them a weapon, and send them over amidst your opponents.  If you have enough influence over the subordinates, and they have a weapon, they\'ll kill that noble for you, and you\'re one corpse closer to winning the game!\n\nThe game is played in a turn-based fashion, using an innovative ""pass the phone"" style.  Each player takes a turn on the device, and then hands it to the next player to take their turn.  The device is handed around between players until one of them wins.  Audio cues triggered during play give other players clues as to what the current player might be doing, which adds to the intrigue.\n\nThis game may be played by 2 to 4 players, however, because it\'s all played on the same device, you only need one copy of the game to play with your friends.  The casual nature of the game makes it an excellent diversion to play while doing other things - hanging out, watching television, on road trips, waiting for the movie to start, etc.  It\'s a fun game to just pull out and run when you want something casual that engages your friends.\n\nThe original version of this game was created for the 2010 Global Game Jam by a team of 4 people.  This version is a cleaned-up and improved version with new features.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n  *  Multiplayer casual strategy for 2-4 players.\n  *  Blackmail, flatter, and intimidate your subordinates to murder your rivals.\n  *  Fun, innovative gameplay that evokes Machiavellian intrigue.\n  *  Casual gameplay makes it ideal for parties, lunch breaks, or just when hanging out.",Barking Dog Interactive,12+,EN,19125248,Games,"Games, Role Playing, Strategy, Entertainment",10/2/2010,10/12/2015

You may play against the computer, or play with one to three other friends or network players via Game Center.  Seats that are not filled by friends or network players are played by the computer.  With the multiplayer game, you may exchange group text messages and voice chats while in the game. \n\nEach player is dealt 13 tiles in a hand. The players take turns to draw a tile and discard one. The goal is to make 4 sets and 1 pair. You can win by drawing a new tile or claiming a discarded tile that completes the hand of 14 tiles. Hands formed must be of some minimum  point value (0-3) in order to win the round. A zero base point would allow chicken hand. The default is 0 base point, but can be customized. \n\nIf the base point is set to greater than zero, an attempt to steal a discard that does not produce the minimum points to win will be preempted by another player\'s claim for pung, for example. Falsely declaring a win when the hand does not meet the base point will be penalized. The claim on a discard to form a hand with enough points to win has priority over other attempts to form kong, punt, or chow.\n\nRefer to wikipedia for a detailed description of the suite and scoring system of the game. \n\nAs few reviewers noted, this game offers realistic play. Drag the tile discarded by another player to your hand to claim it. Drag a tile out to discard it. If you draw a winning or kong tile, push multiple tiles forward to show your hand.    \nYou can move and rearrange the tiles at will.  To have them sorted automatically, do a hoizontal swipe above your hand.\n\nOn iPad, it supports layout on the larger screen in both portrait and landscape modes.\n\nA convenient feature, especially for single handheld play on the iPhone, is you can also click on the hand button to claim a tile or declare a win.\n\nYou can adjust the game speed and sound.  You can also control that hands be of some minimum  point value (0-3) in order to win the round. A zero base point would allow chicken hand.\n\nChoose  ""Align discarded tiles"" to line discarded tiles neatly, else discarded tiles are spinned and placed randomly.\n\nYou can choose to play flower and season tiles.\n\nYou can change the the color of the background and tiles, or use a picture as the game background. \n\nMultitask switching on supported iOS. Game is paused when you switch away from the App and automatically resumed when you return. Resume button is still used to resume game saved if App is terminated (or for older iOS without multitask support).\n\nThe players bank will be shown at the start of the game. To see the bank during the game, tap on the player\'s name.  \n\nYour name in the game is taken from the Game Center alias and can be customized in the Game Center app. If you did not login to Game Center, the name is determine from the following sources (if used) in order: your name used for iCloud, other email, the name on your iPad/iPhone/iTouch.\nYou may customize the names of the computer players.",POK,4+,"EN, ZH, ZH",8246272,Games,"Games, Strategy, Card",17/03/2010,16/05/2019

You can definitely do this and have a ton of fun while you\u2019re at it.\n\nThe idea is to eliminate bits. You start the first game with primary bits. Select one and all possible moves are revealed to you. Okay, start jumping the neighboring bits until there is only one left. There are instances when combined bits will occur and that just adds a new, interesting dimension to the game. But pay attention that the bits don't get stuck. \n\nWhen you get down to one bit, WORP HD starts calculating and opens another memory for you to continue on with.

If so, then Tank Ace 1944 could be the game for you.\n\nIn Tank Ace 1944 you command a World War II tank charging to occupy the enemy capitol. Allied and Soviet Tank Aces advance on Berlin; German Aces advance on London and Moscow. At least that's what the orders from HQ say. But since you face overwhelming odds and are forced to scavenge supplies as you go, you might just find yourself retreating instead.\n\nThe goal of each round of play is to clear the enemy from a map sector and drive them off the far bank of a river so that your side can cross and advance. Skills you will need to accomplish this are a working trigger finger, the ability to navigate West or East (left and right on the overhead map), and driving ability sufficient to crash into other vehicles.\n\nA status panel shows the number of enemies left, rounds remaining, fuel, and armor strength. The last three can be replenished by ramming (not shooting) an enemy truck. If you run out of fuel or armor, or for some reason drive your tank into the water, in addition to an untimely death you will be forced to retreat one sector. If you wipe out the enemies you will advance one sector, retaining any excess supplies you have scavenged. The game ends when you take the enemy capitol, or they overrun yours. Either way the brass will want to have a talk with you\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Play one of three aces: Allied, German, or Soviet.\n- Three tanks: Sherman, Tiger, or T34, each with movable turret and cannon.\n- Destroyable 3D landscape.\n- Perspective or overhead view.\n- Three difficulty settings.\n- Enemy trucks carrying rounds, fuel, and armor.\n- Save / Resume game.\n\nNote: RESETgame does not condone invasion of other countries and cannot accept liability for such an event.""",RESETgame,12+,EN,16104448,Games,"Games, Action, Strategy",1/4/2010,30/09/2016

If so, then Tank Ace 1944 could be the game for you.\n\nIn Tank Ace 1944 you command a World War II tank charging to occupy the enemy capitol. Allied and Soviet Tank Aces advance on Berlin; German Aces advance on London and Moscow. At least that's what the orders from HQ say. But since you face overwhelming odds and are forced to scavenge supplies as you go, you might just find yourself retreating instead.\n\nThe goal of each round of play is to clear the enemy from a map sector and drive them off the far bank of a river so that your side can cross and advance. Skills you will need to accomplish this are a working trigger finger, the ability to navigate West or East (left and right on the overhead map), and driving ability sufficient to crash into other vehicles.\n\nA status panel shows the number of enemies left, rounds remaining, fuel, and armor strength. The last three can be replenished by ramming (not shooting) an enemy truck. If you run out of fuel or armor, or for some reason drive your tank into the water, in addition to an untimely death you will be forced to retreat one sector. If you wipe out the enemies you will advance one sector, retaining any excess supplies you have scavenged. The game ends when you take the enemy capitol, or they overrun yours. Either way the brass will want to have a talk with you.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Play one of three aces: Allied, German, or Soviet.\n- Three tanks: Sherman, Tiger, or T34, each with movable turret and cannon.\n- Destroyable 3D landscape.\n- Perspective or overhead view.\n- Three difficulty settings.\n- Enemy trucks carrying rounds, fuel, and armor.\n- Save / Resume game.\n\nThis is the free Lite version with ads and limited supplies.

With the most powerful Go software available for the iPhone or iPod Touch, Igowin Pro will challenge you no matter what your level, and keep you at the top of your game, on small boards or full size. \n \nIgowin Pro uses the same Go engine as The Many Faces of Go, the three time world computer Go champion. It draws on more than two and a half decades of experience, a massive knowledge base and the newest research, as well as modern Monte Carlo techniques to help you learn and grow as a player. This is, hands down, the strongest Go engine available for the iPhone or iPod Touch.\n\nIgowin Pro supports play on 9x9, 13x13, or 19x19 boards.   This flexible program lets you set your rank as you like.  Game parameters can be set up automatically based on your playing level, or you can choose whatever opponent strength or handicap you want.\n\nA built in \u201cmagnifying glass\u201d helps you put your move exactly where you want it.  Smart move technology snaps your stone into the correct position.  The convenient ""instant-undo"" feature lets you reset a mis-tap without waiting for the computer to finish thinking.\n\nGames can be saved, commented, and emailed as attachments for later study to help improve your play. \n \nIgowin Pro has the most comprehensive tutorial of any app of its kind. You can learn the game basics quickly and begin playing immediately.  You can ask for a hint or an estimate of the current score anytime during a game.  With no complex menus and just a few basic controls, the game is easy to navigate.\n\nAll AI levels are calibrated by actual play, on an online server. That means that the ranking Igowin gives you is very close to what your real-world ranking would be, rather than an arbitrary number that only applies within the app. \n \nIgowin Pro uses the traditional Kyu ranking system to measure your performance. The engine automatically adjusts its level of play to match yours. By using the calibrated rankings within the Go engine, it can play a 9x9 even game, with no handicaps, against any player, from beginner all the way up to 3 Dan level.  19x19 even games automatically adjust from beginner to 3 Kyu. \n \nWhether you\'re a rookie looking for a fun way to learn and play the game of Go, or a crafty veteran looking for a challenge, Igowin is the app you\'ve been searching for. Take Igowin Pro wherever you go, and play it whenever you have a few minutes to burn.

Build a party of fighters, priests, mages and thieves to run deep into the dungeon.  Test your courage and skill against groups of orcs, trolls, vampires and dragons.\n\nEarning its reputation as the thinking man's dungeon game, Oubliette blends the thrill of mortal combat with the sublime challenges of strategy, planning and adaptation.  Rather than testing your reaction speed and nerves, like a first person shooter, Oubliette challenges the player to do careful strategic planning as well as make tactical decisions in the heat of battle.\n\nEach player (character) in the game is created from one of eight player races, which vary in attributes such as strength, intelligence, dexterity and durability.  Elves are highly intelligent and (potentially) immortal, Orcs are strong with short life spans, Dwarves are strong with high wisdom, Kobolds are quite weak in most areas but advance more quickly.\n\nDepending on these attributes, each player will be qualified to join a limited number of player classes (occupations).  More balanced players will have more choices, including Hirebrand (fighter), Mage, Priest and Thief.  Less commonly, players may be qualified for a highly selective class with special skills such as Ranger, Sage, Paladin, Samurai or Ninja.\n\nUnlike games which focus on a single player against multiple opponents, Oubliette allows a party of up to 10 players with complementary skills to face the various types of monsters found in the dungeon.  There are more than 160 different monsters, and to deal with them, more than 150 different pieces of equipment, which may be enchanted with special properties or skills.\n\nOubliette is challenging, but forgiving.  New players commonly have their parties wiped out by an unfamiliar group of monsters.  In fact, your party can meet up to 3 monster groups at the same time!  Use the Temporal Chamber to save a Temporal Portal before dangerous trips.  If things turn out badly, use the Temporal Chamber to turn back the clock and try again.  The trapeze is every bit as thrilling, but safer, with a net below.\n\nIf you are up to the challenge, Oubliette is free to download and play.  Explore the easier levels of the dungeon to build your party and expertise.  And then, when you are ready, feel the power of the game on the deeper levels.  Onward to Glory!""",GabySoft,9+,EN,61472768,Games,"Games, Role Playing, Entertainment, Strategy",26/08/2010,27/05/2015

Rules are simple and intuitive enough for kids to play easily, yet there is more than enough strategic depth to satisfy the most demanding gamer. If you enjoy challenging games like Chess, Checkers, Go, or Shogi, discover Arimaa and see why it was chosen in the Discovery Channel's list of the Top 10 Mind-bending Strategy Games and also recommended by Scientific American MIND magazine.\n\n\u201cThe rules are simple enough for kids to learn, and the game was creative and engaging.\u201d \n\u2014Frederik Joelving; Scientific American Mind magazine\n\nWith millions of opening setups to choose from, every game requires creative thinking right from the beginning and no need to memorize openings. It's a never ending puzzle, each game is different. In just the first 10 moves of Arimaa there's more possible games than there are atoms in our universe.\n\n\u201cBecause the number of possible moves in an Arimaa position (roughly 20,000) is much higher than in chess (about 30 or so), even the fastest computers will not be able to search very far into the tree of possibilities.\u201d \n\u2014R.

'Peppers' is unlike any other match-three on the market today.  We took the match-three concept and raised it to the next level.  \n\nIf you enjoy games like, Bejeweled 2, Jewel Quest, Parking Lot, and Falling Gems, then you will love 'Peppers'.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Four game modes and eight ways to play.\n* Full Version has twenty unique levels.\n* Beautiful graphics and animation.\n* Stores top ten scores with statistics.\n* Jump to any unlocked level.\n* Listen to your own music or jam with ours. \n* Unlock achievement awards.\n* Uses the accelerometer.\n* Supports iOS 4 multitasking.\n* Battery friendly.\n\nHow to Play:\n\nIn each game, it's not just a race against time; one must score enough points in the current level to unlock the next level.  The time allotted for each level will remain the same; however, as each level gets harder the points necessary to unlock the next level will be reduced.  The game will end if the timer runs out and the next level has not been unlocked.\n\nLooking for game hints?  There are none!  Each game will begin with three pepper shakers which are displayed at the top of the screen.  As progress is made through the twenty unique levels the game will get more challenging.  Simply shake or touch the pepper shakers to randomly rearrange the peppers.  Since there are only three pepper shakers per game use them wisely because chances are they will be needed later on.\n\nIf no mores are possible one of three things will happen.  If the next level was unlocked then it will begin.  If not and there are still pepper shakers available then one will be used to continue, otherwise the game will end.\n\nOn Fire:\n\nUnlike traditional match-three games in which only two game pieces swap places, in 'Peppers' entire rows and columns are moved to match three or more peppers.  Once three or more matching peppers are lined up they, along with any adjacent peppers, will begin to shake.  \n\nContinue moving rows and columns to get as many peppers shaking.  Score big points by matching as many peppers as possible.  Keep in mind peppers adjacent to any shaking pepper will also begin to shake.  Rows and columns with any shaking peppers can still be moved around as long as the move results in one or more peppers shaking\n\nIn every other level there will be a 'locked' pepper.  A row with a locked pepper cannot be moved up or down, likewise, a column with a locked pepper cannot be moved left or right.  Score extra points by removing locked peppers.  Once satisfied, press the Fire button. \n\n\nVisit www.peppersthegame.com for additional game hints, screenshots, and videos.\n\nYappler-Tags: Game, Puzzle, Entertaining, Match Three""",CM,4+,EN,14018005,Games,"Games, Strategy, Puzzle, Entertainment",12/7/2010,2/9/2011

In this captivating, dark Gothic puzzle-adventure, use Dr. Helsing's powerful torch and tonics to save the world from the demonic uprising!\n\nAWARDS AND ACCOLADES\nThis is no ordinary game! Helsing's Fire is recognized around the world as one of the App Store's premier puzzle games; full of charm and challenge.\n\n IGF 2011 - Best Mobile Game Finalist\n IGF 2011 - Excellence in Design Honorable Mention\n IGF 2011 - Excellence in Visual Art Honorable Mention\n SlideToPlay - The 50 Best iPhone Games of 2010 (#7)\nTouchArcade - Best iPod Touch and iPhone Games (Puzzle)\n AppAdvice - The Very Best iPhone Games of 2010 (Puzzle)\n TheAppera - Best iPhone Games 2010\n TouchGen - Editor's Choice Awards (Puzzle Runner-up)\n\nPRESS QUOTES\n\nSlideToPlay\n... Helsing's Fire is one of those puzzle games that does something completely original and is unbelievably entertaining.\n\nEurogamer\n... With its insidious wit and gothic charm, Helsing's Fire is a joyously original instant classic that iPhone owners should buy immediately.\n\nTouchArcade\n... It's one of the most unique games I've ever played and is a true App Store gem. Surely only a creature of darkness would let this one slip by them.\n\nTheAppera\n... Helsing's Fire reinvents the puzzle yet again with some light and dark dynamics I guarantee you have NOT seen yet. Prepare to be enthralled!\n\nGamePro\n... This is a game that would absolutely only work on the iOS platform, and it's hands-down one of the best games on the App Store. It gets my highest recommendation.\n\nADDICTIVE PUZZLES\nHelsing's Fire features a brand-new puzzle mechanic never before seen: use the touch-screen to position Helsing's torch to illuminate different combinations of monsters, then destroy them in the correct order using Raffton's supply of different tonics. The quick, rewarding puzzles make it a perfect game for brief play-sessions, but you'll always want to play 'just one more level'!\n\nA HUGE, DARK UNIVERSE\nWith puzzles set across four worlds, with 30 different levels in each world, all featuring fifteen different monster types including four bosses, Helsing's Fire provides an incredibly\nrich, deep, and varied game experience. And because on replays puzzles are re-generated randomly, the game will always be fresh!\n\nCOMPELLING SETTING\nThe Victorian theme, Gothic setting, and engaging characters make Helsing's Fire one of the most appealing story-oriented puzzle games released. Add to that the distinct minimalist style of the character portraits, the incredible dynamic lighting of the shadows cast by your moving torch, and an original soundtrack, and it's clear that Helsing's Fire presents an epic experience. Designed just for the iPhone, this is high-quality mobile gaming at its finest.\n\nMULTIPLE MODES AND ACHIEVEMENTS\nAs if the 120 distinct levels weren't enough, Helsing's Fire also comes with additional Endless Survival and Online Bounty modes, for the bravest of the brave! And when you've stood against the horde as long as you can, you can post your scores on the fully-integrated Crystal leaderboards, earning achievements for your accomplishments and claiming bragging rights from your friends.\n\nDracula must be stopped.

It was released for the Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64 in 1987. It was published in the United Kingdom by Argus Press Software and re-released in Spain by Mind Games Espana S.A.\nThe player takes the control of the human side in a war against the mysterious Insignian race. All of the warfare is carried out by enormous military robots.\nThe player controls a flying machine which can fly over any part of the play-area. The player must build robots and give them orders to attack Insignian robots and capture neutral or enemy factories to increase production and thus aid the war effort. The ultimate objective is to capture all the enemy bases and thus win the war. Everything takes place in real-time with the action being ongoing rather than turn-based. Because the player's view of the battlefield is limited to where their flying-machine is, much of the front-line fighting is left to the machines whilst the player concentrates on building more robots. The game is displayed in forced-perspective isometric graphics.""",Aleksejs Voloviks,4+,EN,4241408,Games,"Games, Entertainment, Strategy, Trivia",29/07/2010,23/10/2018

An IQ level indicates how one is positioned compared to the majority of individuals in a given age bracket.\n\nThe application ""IQ Test: Calculate your IQ"" includes:\n\n*A free test of 10 questions :\nThis 10-question IQ test is based exclusively on logic. It will allow you to evaluate your capacity for reasoning, determine the range of your overall intelligence, and give you a fast estimation of your IQ level.\n\n*Two 50-question IQ tests : (paid)\nThe tests we offer were carefully prepared to evaluate the intelligence level of individuals. Psychologists supervised them preparation.\nYou will be able to calculate your IQ, compare your performance to the rest of the population and receive a detailed analysis of your intelligence.\nThis report gives a detailed assessment of your strengths and weaknesses in the four identified dimensions (verbal, logical, mathematical and spatial intelligence).\n\n*A 50-question IQ test for children aged between 8 and 14 years old. : (paid)\nThe test we offer had been carefully prepared by a psychologist for children aged between 8 and 14 years old. \nIt will allow you to evaluate your intelligence level in four key areas, namely: logic, arithmetic, vocabulary and comprehension.\nThis test was developed especially for children between the ages of 8 and 14 under the supervision of an English-speaking child psychologist. \nIt includes questions that correspond precisely to each age group concerned (8-9 years-old, 10-11 years-old, 12-13 years-old and 14 years-old), and, therefore, in order to obtain an accurate evaluation, it is important to declare the child\'s actual age right at the start of the test. \n\n*The IQ Expert challenge : (paid)\nThis test is intended for high IQ individuals (above 110) \nThe ""expert"" version of the standard IQ test was developed to enable respondents whose IQs are above average (normative IQ score is approximately 104) to take this new and somewhat challenging assessment without answering the same questions usually encountered in IQ tests. \nThis IQ Expert test challenges respondents because it includes questions slightly more difficult than those found in the more traditional IQ tests. \n\nHow to take this test:\n1. You have exactly 35 minutes to answer the 50 questions that follow. A countdown will begin as soon as you start the test and begins again each time the contents of the succeeding page are fully displayed.\n2. You cannot use a calculator, but pen and paper are permitted.\n3. Answer all questions and, if you are not able to, guess the answer. Intuitive responses are taken into account in the general evaluation.\n4. If a question seems to suggest more than a single answer among the given choices, select the one that appears most obvious or more ""reasonable"" to you.\n5. If a youngster of less than 15 years of age wants to take part in an IQ test, we strongly suggest that he/she takes the test for children rather than the regular IQ test. \nIt has been carefully prepared by a psychologist for children aged between 8 and 14 years old.\n\nWhat our users say:\n\nHi, thanx. I really had no problem taking the test. I\'m very satisfied with the results. I\'m really happy that I came off so intelligently! \nI feel truly confident and I had fun with it besides.

Hedgewars is a turn based strategy game but the real buzz is from watching the devastation caused by those pesky hedgehogs with those fantastic weapons - sneaky little blighters with a bad attitude!\n\nIn other words Hedgewars is a turn based strategy, artillery, action and comedy game, featuring the antics of pink hedgehogs with attitude as they battle from the depths of hell to the depths of space.\n\nAs commander, it\'s your job to assemble your crack team of hedgehog soldiers and bring the war to your enemy.\n\nEach player controls a team of several hedgehogs. During the course of the game, players take turns with one of their hedgehogs. They then use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents\' hedgehogs, thereby winning the game. Hedgehogs may move around the terrain in a variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by using particular tools such as the ""Rope"" or ""Parachute"", to move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive thinking or moving. A large variety of tools and weapons are available for players during the game: Grenade, Cluster Bomb, Bazooka, UFO, Shotgun, Desert Eagle, Fire Punch, Baseball Bat, Dynamite, Mine, Rope, Pneumatic pick, Parachute. Most weapons, when used, cause explosions that deform the terrain, removing circular chunks. The landscape is an island floating on a body of water, or a restricted cave with water at the bottom. A hedgehog dies when it enters the water (either by falling off the island, or through a hole in the bottom of it), it is thrown off either side of the arena or when its health is reduced, typically from contact with explosions, to zero (the damage dealt to the attacked hedgehog or hedgehogs after a player\'s or CPU turn is shown only when all movement on the battlefield has ceased). \n\n* Hilarious and devastating turn based combat for up to 8 players\n* Local multiplayer with optional AI opponents\n* Battle on an infinite number of randomly generated maps with over 31 environments, or choose from 48 set image maps\n* Utilise 55 (and counting) devastating weapons! Defeat your foes with simple weapons like Grenades or take it to the next level and trash entire landscapes with weapons like the Melon Bomb or Piano Strike\n* Play the game your way, with 25 different game modifiers, tweak almost every aspect of the match\n* Customize your team, with over 280 costumes, 32 graves, 13 forts, 100s of flags and unique voice packs\n* Huge battles with up to 64 hogs",Anton Malmygin,9+,"BG, DA, EN, FR, DE, IT, JA, PL, PT, RO, RU, ES, TR",181682176,Games,"Games, Casual, Strategy",16/09/2010,2/4/2018

The difference between the levels is the number of enemy craft which increase with the rank you select. The starting energy level of your ship and the remaining playing time also decrease as you progress from one level to the next. The trainee helps you learn the navigation of your ship, and how to operate the weapon systems. In this mode you start out nice and easy, with only one enemy and one star base in each quadrant. After you complete each quadrant, that sector will turn blue so you will know which areas you\'ve already conquered.\n\nMove about under warp drive or impulse power but be aware that the enemy is lurking, waiting to attack you. When your ship gets hit, your equipment may sustain damage. If that happens, the damage reports screens show the estimated time needed to repair your craft.

It simulates the real life paper war games played in the days before portable gaming devices which needed only a pencil, some paper and lots of imagination!\n\n\u2022 Charted #1 Strategy Game in 60 countries!\n\nControl a fleet of planes, tanks and artillery units by taking turns to flick a pencil around a hand-drawn battlefield on a piece of paper, making long curve shots and strategic moves to try and outwit and out-skill your opponent.\n\nReviews:\n\u2022 ""The execution is what makes Lead Wars shine.

While pressing down firmly, slowly tilt the top of the pencil - beyond a critical angle the tip will suddenly slip away leaving a line drawn on the paper. This line determines your move or shot on the battlefield.\n\nLead Wars simulates this mechanic using the touch-screen as if you\'re touching the top of a real pencil.

You start out with quiescence of the elements, but you have to change faith to your advantage. You need a good strategy to break the quiescence \nto your advantage. But be careful, your opponent will try the same thing and you might end up loosing most of you Taijitu pieces that symbolize your faith. \n\n- Yin and Yang takes place between two players. The first player symbolizes the Yin, the second player symbolizes the Yang \n\n-It is played on an 8x8 board of 64 squares. There are 64 Taijitu pieces, colored black for player representing Yin and gold for the player representing Yang. \n\n- In the basic game, the board is set up initially with two Taijitu pieces for each player. The advanced games (Challenge and Master) have more pieces on the initial board) \n\n- Yang (black Taijitu) makes the first moved. Players are then taking alternate turns. \n\n- When making your move, you can change faith by forcing pieces on the board to change from Yin to Yang or Yang to Yin. \n\n- Goal of the game is, once all the pieces are placed to have more pieces than your opponent on the board. \n\n- At each turn a player must place a Taijitu piece with their color face up on one of the empty squares of the board, adjacent to an opponent's Taijitu piece, such that one or \nmore straight lines (horizontal, vertical or diagonal) are formed from the newly placed disc, through one or more of the opponent's discs and up to other Taijitu pieces of their own color already \non the board. All the intervening Taijitu pieces of the opponent's color are flipped to the faith (Yin/Yang) of the newly laid Taijitu piece. \n\n-Taijitu pieces may be flipped from one faith to the other but once played are not moved from one square to another or removed from the board. \n\n- Players may not pass unless there is no valid move available to them in which case they must pass. \n\n-Play continues until neither player is able to move, usually when all 64 squares have been played. \n\n- The player with most piece of their faith wins \n\n\nHistory \n\nIn Chinese philosophy, the concept of yin yang, normally \nreferred to in the West as yin and yang) is used to describe how polar or seemingly contrary forces are interconnected and interdependent in the natural world, and how they give rise to each other \nin turn. The concept lies at the origins of many branches of classical Chinese science and philosophy, as well as being a primary guideline of traditional Chinese medicine, and a central principle of \ndifferent forms of Chinese martial arts and exercise, such as baguazhang, taijiquan (tai chi), and qigong (Chi Kung) and of I Ching divination. Many natural dualities \u2014 e.g. dark and light, \nfemale and male, low and high, cold and hot \u2014 are thought of as manifestations of yin and yang (respectively). \nYin yang are complementary opposites that interact within a greater whole, as part of a dynamic system. Everything has both yin and yang aspects, but either of these aspects may manifest more strongly \nin particular objects, and may ebb or flow over time. The concept of yin and yang is often symbolized by various forms of the Taijitu symbol, for which it is probably best known in western cultures. \nThere is a perception (especially in the West) that yin and yang correspond to good and evil (not respectively). However, Taoist philosophy generally discounts good/bad distinctions and other \ndichotomous moral judgments, in preference to the idea of balance. Confucianism (most notably the philosophy of D. Zhongshu, circa the second century BCE) did attach a moral dimension to the idea \nof yin and yang, but the modern sense of the term largely stems from Buddhist adaptations of Taoist philosophy. \n\n---------------------- \nThis game is enabled for GameCenter and allows you to play against other players through GameCenter.""",Uwe Meier,4+,EN,24873984,Games,"Games, Board, Strategy",14/12/2010,10/11/2017

The quick, rewarding puzzles make it a perfect game for brief play-sessions, but you'll always want to play 'just one more level'!\n\nA HUGE, DARK UNIVERSE\nWith puzzles set across four worlds, with 30 different levels in each world, all featuring fifteen different monster types including four bosses, Helsing's Fire provides an incredibly\nrich, deep, and varied game experience. And because on replays puzzles are re-generated randomly, the game will always be fresh!\n\nCOMPELLING SETTING\nThe Victorian theme, Gothic setting, and engaging characters make Helsing's Fire one of the most appealing story-oriented puzzle games released. Add to that the distinct minimalist style of the character portraits, the incredible dynamic lighting of the shadows cast by your moving torch, and an original soundtrack, and it's clear that Helsing's Fire presents an epic experience. Designed just for the iPhone, this is high-quality mobile gaming at its finest.\n\nMULTIPLE MODES AND ACHIEVEMENTS\nAs if the 120 distinct levels weren't enough, Helsing's Fire also comes with additional Endless Survival and Online Bounty modes, for the bravest of the brave! And when you've stood against the horde as long as you can, you can post your scores on the fully-integrated Crystal leaderboards, earning achievements for your accomplishments and claiming bragging rights from your friends.\n\nDracula must be stopped.

The players of the same team sit across from each other at a card table. Bridge consists of two parts: the auction, which determines the contract to fulfil, and the play, where the side that wins the bidding tries to take the tricks necessary to make their contract.\n \nOn Funbridge, you play South while North, East and West are played by the same artificial intelligence (AI) at all tables. So no need to wait until other players are available to play. The AI is available 24/7!\n\nOther players play the same deals as you. The aim is to achieve the best result. You enter rankings allowing you to compare your play to other players.\n\nFunbridge is designed for any type of players: from beginners (introductory module, lessons, exercises) to experts (tournaments). It also suits any player who wants to start playing bridge again (practice, challenges against friends).\n\nGame modes:\n- Get started with bridge: (re)discover the basics of bridge.\n- Series tournaments: perfect to see how you compare with players of your level.\n- Tournaments of the day: compare yourself to players from all around the world.\n- Practice deals: play deals at your own pace without stress.\n- Face the elites: pit yourself against top players from the Elite series.\n- Challenges: challenge any player in head-to-head tournaments.\n- Two-player game: practise with your favourite partner.\n- Team Championship: create your team and compete against teams from all over the world.\n- Federation tournaments: improve your federation ranking thanks to official tournaments held conjointly with bridge federations.\n- Funbridge Points tournaments: play these tournaments to enter the Funbridge Points rankings and compare yourself to all players.\n- Exclusive tournaments: create your own tournaments and discuss the deals you play.\n- Commented tournaments: get valuable advice from a bridge champion.\n\nYou can also:\n- Pause your deal or tournament\n- Watch a replay of other players\' moves\n- Replay deals that you have already played\n- Get the meaning of the bids made at the table\n- Seek advice from the AI in case of doubt\n- Set your bidding and card play conventions\n- Access an analysis of your play once the deal is over\n- Meet your friends and chat with them\n\nInternet connection required: the AI is not in the app, which is therefore much more efficient and we can continuously improve it without you having to update it.\n\nGENERAL TERMS OF USE, PRIVACY POLICY, SUBSCRIPTION, PRICES:\nThe Funbridge app offers a monthly subscription (1 month) and a yearly subscription (1 year).\nIf you subscribe in another currency, the price may vary slightly if your bank charges you a conversion fee.\nPayment for your subscription will be debited from your account after your purchase is confirmed.\nThe subscription is automatically renewed at the end of the subscription period.

It is a mobile game board for use on travel or at home. Searching for lost pieces is a thing of the past.\nOptionally Halma for iPad can validate the moves on the board. With move validation active the following restrictions are applied to moves:\n\n\u2022 Only moves or Jumps according to the rules are possible.\n\n\u2022 After a single field move no further move will be possible. If the move was an error you must use the undo button - that is the button with the blue arrow pointing to the left - to go back.\n\n\u2022 After a Jump only further Jumps will be possible. A single field move following a Jump will not be accepted.\n\n\u2022 After moving a piece of a certain color it will not be possible to move another piece of the same color. Note: This validation will not apply after one player has endet the game and End of Game recognition is on. Thus the other players are able to count how many moves are missing.\n\nFor games with three players there is an option for validating the play direction (clockwise or anticlockwise), which can be chosen by an agreement between the players before the game starts. The play direction is determined with the first move of the second player in the game, i.e. the second color in use. Note: This validation will not apply after one player has endet the game and End of Game recognition is on.\n\nMore Options:\n\n\u2022 End of Move recognition - automatic deselection of a piece if no further move is possible.\n\n\u2022 remember the game status when the application is suspended and restarted later.\n\n\u2022 End of Game recognition - bringing the last piece home is reflected by a tiny animation.\n\n\u2022 Soundeffects on or off\n\n\u2022 Display of the current time\n\n\u2022 Color selector for each player\n\nWhat this App is not:\n\nHalma for iPad is not a Computer Game in common sense.

If your chosen number can be formed from the rerolled dice, this score is added automatically. This continues until you can't form the chosen number again, or when you are awarded a 'Hekkie'. When you get a 'Hekkie', you get to roll again as if it is a new turn, else it's the end of your turn.

Word Assist was designed to help you improve your play, yet not do so much, that it takes away the excitement and challenge of the game. Word Assist frees you from the tedium of searching a long list of words, or guessing at random combinations of letters hoping for a valid word, and allows you to focus on the real strategy of the game.\n\nOn the Home screen of Word Assist, you can enter your letter tiles, then enter your search string, a maximum length for the word, and click a button to look for the search string at the start of the word, the end of the word, or anywhere in the middle of the word. Example, say your tiles are z,h,o,r,t,e,u and there is a word on your game board 'back'.  You could enter 'back' as the search term, with a max len of 15 and click In Middle, and you would get results such as 'backhoe' worth 19 points or 'outback' worth 18 points.  The results returned are all those words that can be made given the search term (tiles already on the board) and your own letter tiles.\n\nNow, Word Assist does not take into account Double or Triple Word or Letter square values.  This is where the player must employ their own strategy, and is what keeps the game fun to play.  A result that may have a lower word score may be more valuable if a high value tile falls on a Triple Letter square, so, it is up to the player to choose the best word from the list of results.  Why play the game at all if your App plays the game for you?\n\nHere are some other search terms that you could enter and what they mean:\n\nYour Tiles: d,a,e,n,r,i,r\n\nSearch term 'elude' with a max length of 15, clicking In Middle returns 'deluder', 'deluded', 'eluded', 'eluder'\n\nYou can also use an underscore to be a placeholder for any one of your tiles:\n\nSearch term 'v_i' with a max length of 8, clicking In Middle returns 'vainer', 'vein' etc.\n\nWord Assist also has a Lookup Screen (click the magnifying glass on the Home Screen navigation bar). The Lookup Screen searches the dictionary without any regard for the tiles that you have. So, it is a way for you to verify if a particular word you have in mind is in the dictionary or not. For example, if you were not sure if 'na' was a valid word, you could enter this in the search field on the Lookup Screen, click Search, and if the word is returned as a result, then it was found in the dictionary.  If no results were returned, it does not exist in the dictionary.\n\nYou may perform some advanced searches on the Lookup screen using 'wildcard' characters. So, similar to the way we used the underscore (_) character on the Home Screen to be a placeholder for any single character, you could enter 'f_z' in the Search field and click Search and the words 'fez' and 'fiz' will be returned. In effect, your wildcard search requested any three letter word starting with 'f' and ending with 'z'. \n\nYou can also use the wildcard character '%' to represent 'any number of characters'. So, if you entered '%z' in the Search Field and clicked Search, then you would get results such as 'razzamatazz' (worth 50 points!). Your wildcard search requested words of any length ending with the letter 'z'. \n\nYou may also combine wildcard characters. So, if you entered '__z%' in the Search field, and clicked Search, you would get 'razzamatazz' and 'zyzzyvas' since you requested words of any length, starting with any two letters followed by a 'z'. \n\nWord Assist eliminates the tedium of looking through long word lists for valid words, without taking away the fun and challenge of playing the game!""",Michael Dougan,4+,EN,18002944,Games,"Games, Word, Strategy, Utilities",17/03/2011,10/8/2017
